<p>Hi everyone! I want to help you finally move beyond your current level of English.</p>

<p>I have been teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) for more than 10 years.</p>

<p>I have taught in Japan, Argentina, Guatemala, New York City, and here in Boston. In my free time, I like to travel and explore, work on my Spanish, and meet new people.</p>

<p>I am originally from Washington, D.C., but moved to New York nearly five years ago.</p>

<p>I received my MA is TESOL at The New School in 2014 and have been working in the field ever since. I studied theatre in college and worked in broadcast and radio for several years.</p>

<p>I believe learning should be more than just sitting down and studying. I feel if students are motivated by a fun classroom atmosphere and interesting subject matter, they will learn the language in a more effective way. I enjoy teaching pronunciation and have a special passion for teaching English through music, television, and movies.</p>

<p>Travel is a huge passion of mine. I also love singing, writing and playing music, and comedy. I have even been known to bring in my guitar and sing in the classroom to create a lesson. Thanks for listenting!</p>

<p>Much of the first half of my career was spent in Taipei, Taiwan, and now I live in the fabulous city of Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>Whether I'm teaching test preparation or conversation, I believe that the best way to learn is by using new information in fun and motivating ways.</p>

<p>In my free time, I delight in exploring this amazing world with my son, running around with my dog, reading comic books, watching sci-fi and stand-up comedy, and cheering for the Portland Timbers.<p>
